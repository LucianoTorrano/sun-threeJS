# sun-threeJS

Sun made with ThreeJS. First I made a Sphere Geometry object and then I use a sun uv map as a texture. Adding some phisics the result is a sun rotating in time.
Also you can control the scene with the following controls:<br><br>

<h3><b>MOUSE CONTROLS:</b></h3><br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Left click:</b> Hold left click and move around in order to increase or decrease the rotation of the sun.<br></li>
  <li><b>Right click:</b> Hold right click and move arround in order to change the position of the sun in the Scene.<br></li>
  <li><b>Scroll:</b> Use the scroll to zoom in or out the scene.<br></li>
</ul>
<br>
